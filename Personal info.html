							<h2>About me
							</h2>
						</header>
							<p>
								My name is Anthimos Aristidou, a data analyst with a background in risk management, healthcare and project management.
							<p>
								Currently, I work as a freelancer, offering data insights to organisations. I use data backed solutions to solve business problems. Data visualisations and analysis are some techniques that I use to achieve that. Some of the software I use are R programming, SQL, Excel and Tableau, while I am also learning to code in Python.

							<h2>My story
							</h2>
						</header>
							<p>
								I studied Physiology at the University of Aberdeen, where my thesis focused on repairing spinal cord nerve cells using omega-3 endocannabinoids.
								Following that, I worked for the NHS in England during the COVID-19 pandemic, where I tested A&E patients for COVID. Later, I transitioned to business consulting and had the opportunity to work and learn from the best at companies such as HSBC and MS Amlin.				
						
							<p>
								But my true passion was using data to solve the problems my customers were facing. With an existing passion for coding, I decided to pursue a career as a data analyst. I completed the Google Data Analytics Certificate to gain the necessary skills and provide insights to my customers, enabling them to make data-backed decisions.
